# scaffolding

10min idea in how, we direct ai into the creation of a codebase.

The idea is to keep input and output constrained to the ai, and letting it decide how to code based on these constraints. We would let it simulate multiple rounds of code, and then let it pick one based on criteria we have chosen.

Essentially openapi for ai, but with the notion, that every function should have a yml definition. 

Since this is a 10 min idea, I have not tried to adhere to `json-schema` or anything similar.
